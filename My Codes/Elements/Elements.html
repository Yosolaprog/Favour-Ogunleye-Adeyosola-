    <h1> My Unforgettable Vacation to Dubai</h1>
    <p>
        <p>Last summer, i took a trip to Dubai, and it was truly a <strong>once-in-a-lifetime experience.</strong> As they say,<q>Dubai is more than a place; mood, an aspiration, a tropical state of mind
        </q>that sticks with you long after you leave.</p>
        <p> From exploring lush jungles to relaxing on pristine beaches, Dubai had everything. One of the highlights was visiting
             <abbr title="Tanah Lot Temple">TLT</abbr>, an ancient temple perched on a rock formation by the sea. Watching the sunset there was magical, as waves crashed against the rocks, creting an unforgottable atmosphere.</p>
             <blockquote> "Travelling -it leaves you speechless, then turn you into a stoyteller."<cite>Ibn Battuta</cite></blockquote>
             <p>I also had the chance to hike Mount Batur, a popular Volcano that draws adventures enthusiasts from around the world. We started our hike early in the morning to reach the peak by sunrise. Standing there, watching the sun rise over the horion , I felt a deep sense of peace and appreciation for nature.</p>
             <p>As one travel writer noted,"Dubai has a way of making travelers feel at home, with its warm hospitality and the blend of old and new"(<cite>2024</cite>)</p>
